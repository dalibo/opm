This function automatically generates for wh_nagios all graphs for a specified
server. If this function is called multiple times, it will only generate
"missing" graphs. A graph will be considered as missing if a label is not
present in any graph. Therefore, it's currently impossible not to graph a label.
FIXME: fix this limitation.
