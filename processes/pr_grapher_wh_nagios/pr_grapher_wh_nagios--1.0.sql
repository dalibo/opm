'This table defines which labels (series) appears in each graphs.
As this module is related to the UI, each time a new label is added to
an existing service, a new graph is created with this new label
automatically. We make the difference between a new label appearing from
a service with an old one deactivated in every related graphs using
"id_graph IS NULL". So as far as a label exists in this table, it is not
new and a new graph will not be created.
The natural PK here should be on (id_label, id_graph). But as "id_graph"
is NULLable we only use a UNIQUE INDEX.';

Function pr_grapher.create_graph_for_wh_nagios(p_id_server bigint) returns boolean

This function automatically generates for wh_nagios all graphs for a specified
server. If this function is called multiple times, it will only generate
"missing" graphs. A graph will be considered as missing if a label is not
present in any graph. Therefore, it's currently impossible not to graph a label.
FIXME: fix this limitation.
